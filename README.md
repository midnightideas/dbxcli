# Dbxcli

A command line tool for Dropbox users and team admins

_Note - This repo does not contain the `dbxcli` binary. Instead, it downloads the latest version from https://github.com/dropbox/dbxcli, and packages the codes into the Homebrew formula. The formula is re-built daily via the CI/CD pipeline._

## Installation

### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Mac

Run

```bash
brew tap midnightideas/extras
brew install dbxcli
```
